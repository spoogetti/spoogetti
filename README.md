# Hello there, I'm Romain (or spoogetti as per my Github username), a confirmed Web developer 👋
I'm pretty basic in everything because of my education but I focus on PHP (Laravel, Symfony) and Javascript (NodeJS, VueJS) and am an [aspiring t-shaped developer](https://letslearnabout.net/blog/what-it-is-a-t-shaped-developer-and-why-you-should-be-one/).
